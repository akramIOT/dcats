# DCATS: Dual-Layer Cognitive Architecture for Trustworthy and Secure AI Systems

Implementation of the dual-layer cognitive architecture described in the research paper "Dual-Layer Cognitive Architecture for Trustworthy and Secure AI Systems".

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of two main layers:

1. **Core Reasoning Layer (C)**: Primary AI reasoning engine
2. **Oversight Layer (O)**: Cognitive firewall with four main components:
   - Attention Filter (O_filter)
   - Trust Scorer (O_trust) 
   - Memory Partitioner (O_mem)
   - Output Veto (O_veto)

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from src.dcats import DualLayerAI

# Initialize the system
ai_system = DualLayerAI()

# Process input through dual-layer architecture
result = ai_system.process("What is our sales revenue?")
```
